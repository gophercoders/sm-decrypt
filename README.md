## GopherCoders.com Caesar Cipher Decryption Program

This program decrypts one word according to the [Caesar Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher).

The program currently encrypts, not decrypts according to the Caesar Cipher.
The pupils have to change the program so that in decrypts the encrypted
message.

The changes are very limited and show the relationship between encryption and
decryption in the Caesar Cipher.

Decrypting more than one one word is a trivial extension that can be worked
through with the class after they have completed this program.
